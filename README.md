# :speaking_head: About
> The objective of this project is for us to create a simple shell. Yes, out own little bash or zsh. We will lear a lot about processes and file descriptors and This project was one of the most challenging yet
  indulging projects of the 42 curriculum that I have faced so far, when you have to deal with many test cases and when you get to learn many things, from software architecture, system calls, file descriptorsâ€¦ to team coordination, management, and work distribution

# :hammer_and_wrench: Supported Features

### Minishell is a miniature shell program based on Bash and it suppports:
- Ponmpt display
- Command history(up and down arrows)
- System executables available from the environment(ls, cat, grep ... etc.)
- Local executable(./minishell)
- Builtin commands :
   - `echo` (with option -n)
   - `cd` (with ~ (tilde) flag, - (prev. dir), absalute and relative paths)
   - `pwd` (with no options)
   - `export` (with no options)
   - `unset` (with no options)
   - `exit` (with exit number)
   - `env` (with no options or arguments)
- Pipes `|` with redirect output from one command to input for the next
- Redirections:
     - `>` redirects output
     - `>>` redirects output in append mode
     - `<` redirects input
     - `<< DELIMETER` Heredoc displays a new prompt, reads user input untill reachinig DELIMETER, redirects user input to command input (does not update history)
- Environment variables (i.e. `$USER` or `$VAR`) that expand to their values.
    - `$?` expands to the exit status of last executed foreground pipeline.
- User keybord signals:
     - `Ctrl+C` displays new prompt line in interactive mode (Parent process), in non-interactive mode (child process) interupts process with the signal `SIGINT` and updates exit_status to 131.
     - `Ctrl+D` exits any  kind of process (if the prompt is empty)
     - `Ctrl+\` does nothing in interactive mode (parent process) and in non-interactive mode (child process) sends the signal `SIGQUIT` to interupt non-interactive process.
> [!NOTE]
> Minishell does not support `\`, `;`, `&&`, `||`, or `wildcards`

> [!TIP]
> For more test cases you can clone the repo and run the program :shushing_face:


# :hammer_and_pick: Run the program
## Unix
  > Clone the repository:
```

  git clone https://github.com/YusuCoder/minishell.git

``` 
> Go to the root folder run following commands:
```

      make
      ./minishell

```

# :spiral_notepad: Conclusion
### Definition
> Minishell is a hands-on project designed to deepen your understanding of Unix shell behavior and system-level programming. By creating this simplified shell,
> you gain practical experience with core concepts such as process management, file descriptors, and system calls. This project not only reinforces your knowledge
> of how shells operate but also provides a solid foundation for tackling more advanced shell features and system programming challenges in the future.
